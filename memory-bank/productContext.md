## Project Goal

A fitness app that uses fantasy sports mechanics to make health, exercise, and friendly competition fun and engaging. Users compete in leagues (solo, 1v1, or team-based) to log workouts, earn points, and track progress.

## Brand Voice & Messaging

Playful, sarcastic, and encouragingâ€”like your funniest coach from high school. Users should feel challenged and supported, with language that's direct, lighthearted, and a little tough-love. Think ESPN fantasy meets group chat trash talk.
